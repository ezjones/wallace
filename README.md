**WALLACE** brings freedom to DaVinci Resolve Studio users on Linux. Not the
grand,
historical kind — the kind where you double-click an `.mp4` and the audio
actually plays.

Blackmagic ship Resolve with AAC decode removed for licensing reasons, which
means a great many ordinary `.mp4` and `.mov` files import with silent audio.
Wallace puts it back, natively, without transcoding anything — and wraps it all
in a GUI, so you don't have to think about binary patching on a deadline.

Concretely: Wallace is a **fork of [josephg/resolve-aacfix]** that adds a
desktop GUI and support for the latest DaVinci Resolve 21 releases. All the
reverse engineering, binary patching and tooling is upstream's; this fork adds
the point-and-click layer and keeps pace with Resolve 21.

```sh
tar -xzf wallace-*.tar.gz
cd wallace-*
sudo ./aac-fix install          # close Resolve first
./aac-fix status
```

Download the tarball from [Releases](../../releases). It needs only `python3`
and `binutils`; everything else is bundled.

To undo it completely (the English finally catch up):

```sh
sudo ./aac-fix uninstall
```

---

## The usual workaround, and why it gets you killed

The standard advice for AAC-in-Resolve pain is: *"just convert your audio to
PCM"*. And honestly? For one or two files, on a solo project, in your own
timeline, it works fine. Nobody gets hurt.

Now try that in a team environment. Converting audio tracks means **modifying
(or replacing and relinking) source media**. On shared storage. Where other
people's timelines, bins and relinks live. The moment your re-encoded,
renamed, PCM-flavoured copies of the camera originals touch a shared project,
you have stopped being an editor and started being a hazard. One "helpful"
conversion of the master media folder and *you* are the reason the offline
edit sounds different from the online edit. That is the sort of thing you do
not recover from professionally.

Wallace's whole point is that you never have to: the source media stays
exactly as the camera delivered it, and Resolve simply learns to read it.

## The GUI

```sh
cd gui-v2
npm install
npm run tauri dev     # or: npm run tauri build
```

## What it does

AAC is blocked in two places, and lifting either one alone achieves nothing:

1. **`bin/resolve`** never asks for AAC. Eight [e9patch] trampolines un-gate the
   `aac ` fourcc and AAC codec-id paths for QuickTime (`.mp4`/`.mov`/`.m4a`) and
   Matroska, and route them to FFmpeg.
2. **`libs/libav*.so`** — Blackmagic's bundled FFmpeg has the AAC decoder
   compiled *out*. Four drop-in replacements with identical sonames put it back.

`aac-fix status` reports both, and warns about the half-installed case, because
"binary patched, libs not" fails silently as no audio.

**Every binary change is purely additive.** Each trampoline acts only when the
value is AAC and otherwise lets the original instruction run untouched. No
existing instruction is rewritten. AC-3, FLAC, ALAC, MP3, PCM, the `NONE` fourcc
and Blackmagic's AV3A / "Audio Vivid" demuxer all keep working, and `uninstall`
restores the original binary byte-for-byte.

Patch sites are found by **version-independent byte signatures**, not hardcoded
offsets. On a build it does not recognise, the patcher refuses cleanly and writes
nothing.

## Caveats

Please read these before installing.

- **Studio only.** Built and tested against DaVinci Resolve **Studio**. The free
  version has not been tested at all.
- **Resolve 21 only.** Validated on 21.0.0, 21.0.3 and 21.0.4; the full
  end-to-end test was on **21.0.4**. Because sites are located by signature, newer
  21.x point releases *should* work — but this has not been tested beyond 21.0.4.
  **If the patcher refuses, or something misbehaves, please [file an
  issue](../../issues)** with your exact Resolve version and the output of
  `./aac-fix status`. A refusal is a broken feature, not a broken install: it
  writes nothing.
- **Linux, x86-64 only.**
- **Works:** `.mp4`, `.mov`, `.m4a`, and `.mkv` **that contain a video track**.
  LC-AAC and HE-AAC.
- **Does not work:** raw `.aac` (ADTS), `.ts`, `.flv`, `.latm`, MXF. These use
  other decoder classes inside Resolve that have not been analysed. See
  [`docs/further-work.md`](docs/further-work.md) — the groundwork makes them much
  cheaper than the first one was.
- **Audio-only MKV is silent — and that is a pre-existing Resolve bug, not this
  patch.** An MKV with no video track plays no audio in Resolve *for any codec*:
  it reproduces with native FLAC, AC-3 and MP3 audio-only MKVs, which Resolve
  supports and which this patch does not touch. It remains true for AAC. Put a
  video track in the file, or use another container.
- **HE-AAC sample rate:** only *explicit* SBR/PS signalling is handled. Implicit
  SBR and the AOT=31 escape will report the base sample rate.
- **Close Resolve before installing or uninstalling.** Writing a running binary
  fails with `ETXTBSY`.
- **No warranty.** This modifies a large proprietary binary in place. It keeps a
  verified backup and refuses to restore a corrupt one, but you should be able to
  reinstall Resolve if you need to.

## Licensing

AAC and AC-3 were removed from a shipping product for **licensing, not
technical, reasons**. This is interoperability work on a binary you have already
installed on your own machine. Whether re-enabling these codecs is appropriate
for a given use — especially for distributed output — is a licensing question,
and it is out of scope here.

The FFmpeg libraries are a plain LGPL build using FFmpeg's own native AAC
decoder: no `--enable-gpl`, no `--enable-nonfree`, no external codec libraries.

## Building a patched `.deb`

On Debian/Ubuntu/Mint you can build a patched package straight from Blackmagic's
`.run` installer, so the fix survives reinstalls:

```sh
./aac-fix build-deb DaVinci_Resolve_Studio_21.0.4_Linux.run
```

This wraps [makeresolvedeb] unmodified (downloaded pinned and SHA-256 verified).
Needs `fakeroot`, `dpkg-deb`, `curl`, and roughly 8 GB of free disk.

## Building from source

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ezjones/wallace && cd wallace
scripts/dev-setup.sh          # e9patch + trampoline, capstone/pyelftools, FFmpeg
sudo ./aac-fix install
```

The FFmpeg build targets **glibc 2.28** whatever you build it on: Resolve's own
binary references at most `GLIBC_2.27`, and Blackmagic's supported baseline for
Resolve 21 is Rocky Linux 8 (glibc 2.28). Libraries built on a current distro
reference `GLIBC_2.35` and would install fine and then fail to load on a machine
where Resolve runs perfectly well. So `build-ffmpeg.sh` runs the compile inside a
`rockylinux:8` container unless the host is already that old, then verifies the
glibc floor of what it produced and fails if it is too high — locally and in CI
alike. That needs `docker` or `podman`; see
[`docs/ffmpeg-libs.md`](docs/ffmpeg-libs.md#targeting-glibc-228).
